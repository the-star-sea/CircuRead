# CircuRead：A Distributed Academic Idea Review System

This system leverages GitHub and GitHub Actions to create a secure, transparent, and traceable distributed review process for academic idea notes. It ensures ideas are collaboratively reviewed, signatures are immutable, and version history is fully maintained.

## Features

  * **Decentralized Storage:** Each participant maintains their own GitHub repository for idea notes, ensuring data resilience and eliminating single points of failure.
  * **Version Control:** Leverages Git's powerful version control to track every change, addition, and signature, providing a complete historical record.
  * **Immutable Signatures:** Utilizes Git's commit signing (GPG) to ensure the authenticity of each signature and the integrity of the idea note content.
  * **LaTeX Integration:** Supports idea notes written in LaTeX, allowing for professional and consistent formatting.
  * **Automated Review Workflow:** GitHub Actions can automate checks and notifications for review requests.
  * **Tiered Privileges:** Access to repositories is managed through GitHub's built-in permissions, allowing for clear roles (student, advisor, professor, etc.).

## How It Works

At its core, this system treats each idea note and its review process as a series of Git commits in a distributed repository.

1.  **Student's Repository:** Each student creates a private GitHub repository for their idea notes.
2.  **Idea Note Creation:** Students write their idea notes in LaTeX, committing them to their repository.
3.  **Review Request:** When an idea is ready for review, the student can either:
      * Push their changes and notify their advisor.
      * Open a pull request to a designated `review` branch (if structured that way).
4.  **Advisor's Review & Signature:**
      * The advisor clones the student's repository.
      * They review the idea note. If approved, they **add their name and a GPG-signed commit** to the LaTeX file (e.g., in a dedicated signature section).
      * This signed commit acts as their immutable approval.
5.  **Hierarchical Review:** Good ideas can be "promoted" up the chain:
      * An advisor can then create a new commit (or push their version) to their own repository, including the student's idea and their signature.
      * They then request review from a professor, who repeats the process.
      * Each level of review adds a new, cryptographically verifiable signature to the idea note's history.
6.  **Immutable Record:** Git's cryptographic hashing ensures that any attempt to tamper with past commits or signatures will invalidate the subsequent history, making tampering easily detectable.

## Why This System?

This distributed academic idea review system is designed with several key objectives in mind:

  * **Academic Transparency:** By maintaining a complete, verifiable history of idea development and review, we foster an environment of open scrutiny and accountability. Every contribution and every signature is permanently recorded, enhancing trust and clarity in the academic process.
  * **Better Discovery of Good Ideas:** The structured, hierarchical review process allows promising ideas to naturally surface and gain visibility. As ideas are reviewed and endorsed by progressively senior academics, truly impactful concepts can be identified earlier and brought to the attention of the wider academic community.
  * **Concentrate Resources on Major Undertakings (集中力量办大事):** This system helps us efficiently channel attention and resources towards the most impactful and validated research ideas. By systematically elevating strong proposals, we ensure that valuable time, funding, and intellectual effort are focused on initiatives that have the greatest potential for significant academic contribution. This strategic allocation helps us achieve breakthrough results more effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * A GitHub account.
  * Basic understanding of Git commands.
  * A GPG key for signing commits (recommended for reviewers).
      * [Generating a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
      * [Telling Git about your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)

### Setup

1.  **Create Your Repository:**
      * Students: Create a **private** GitHub repository for your idea notes (e.g., `my-idea-notes`).
      * Advisors/Professors: You might also have your own repositories where you collect reviewed ideas from your students.
2.  **LaTeX Template (Optional but Recommended):**
      * Consider creating a standard LaTeX template for idea notes that includes a dedicated section for signatures (e.g., using `\signature{Name}{Date}{GPG_Fingerprint}`).
3.  **Configure Git for Signing:**
      * Ensure Git is configured to sign your commits using your GPG key.
        ```bash
        git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID
        git config --global commit.gpgsign true # Automatically sign all commits
        ```

### Workflow

1.  **Student's Initial Submission:**
      * Write your idea note in LaTeX (e.g., `idea-note-01.tex`).
      * Add and commit your file:
        ```bash
        git add idea-note-01.tex
        git commit -S -m "Initial idea note: [Your Idea Title]" # -S signs the commit
        git push origin main
        ```
      * Share the repository link (or invite collaborators) with your advisor.
2.  **Advisor's Review & Signature:**
      * Clone the student's repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/student-username/my-idea-notes.git
        cd my-idea-notes
        ```
      * Review `idea-note-01.tex`.
      * If approved, edit `idea-note-01.tex` to add your signature (e.g., `\signature{Dr. Jane Doe}{\today}{ABC123DEF456}` inside the document).
      * Commit the change with your GPG signature:
        ```bash
        git add idea-note-01.tex
        git commit -S -m "Approved and signed by Dr. Jane Doe for idea-note-01"
        git push origin main
        ```
      * **To promote:** If the idea needs further review by a professor, the advisor can then "forward" this version. This might involve creating a new repository for approved ideas or simply sharing the current student repo with the professor.
3.  **Professor's Review & Signature (and so on):**
      * Repeat the process from the advisor's step. Each subsequent review adds a new, signed commit to the history.

## Signature Verification

The integrity of this system relies on Git's commit signing. You can verify the authenticity of any commit (and thus, the signature) in a GitHub repository:

  * **On GitHub:** Look for the "Verified" badge next to commit messages. Clicking it will show details about the GPG signature.
  * **Locally using Git:**
    ```bash
    git log --show-signature
    ```
    This will display the GPG signature for each commit, indicating whether it's valid.

## Contributing

This is a conceptual framework. If you have ideas for improving the workflow, automation with GitHub Actions, or better LaTeX integration, feel free to open issues or pull requests.
